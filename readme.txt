The basic spleef block is craftable from obsidian glass and a mese shard and a coal lump. The other items are not craftable or obtainable: they are spawnned as a result of gameplay. Punching a spleef node turns it into a flashing spleef node, which quickly disappears (turns into an air-like node). Spleef fire nodes sometimes occur from punching a node. They spawn fire above them, and can be puched again to disappear.
